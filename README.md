## Installation
cargo install mcserver

## Configuration

### Static
To change the static configuration, you will need to build the crate from source and create a static_config.toml file in the crate root. This can be done if you either want a contact or want to change the configuration directory.

### Dynamic
To change the dynamic configuration, edit your config.toml file (which is in ~/.config/mcserver/ by default).
